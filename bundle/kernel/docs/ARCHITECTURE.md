# Workstation Architecture

## Design Goal

The workstation converts model capability into repeatable, governable organizational capability. It does not depend on a single model, IDE, or vendor. Instead, it is organized around six durable capability domains.

## Six Capability Domains

| Domain | Repository mechanism | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context architecture | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `changes/` | Give AI the smallest sufficient context at the right time |
| Tool system | `skills/`, external connection inventory | Package expertise and connect to real systems safely |
| Execution orchestration | `workflows/`, change task lists | Make complex work decomposable, transferable, and verifiable |
| State and memory | Git, specifications, decision records | Preserve consistency across sessions and contributors |
| Evaluation and observability | `scripts/`, CI, audit reports | Measure quality, cost, and reliability with evidence |
| Guardrails and recovery | `rules/`, approval boundaries, rollback plans | Prevent boundary violations and reduce recovery cost |

## Execution Control Artifacts

Conversation is a transient interface, not the source of truth. Material work is controlled by five artifacts:

| Artifact | Purpose | Primary writer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requirements.md` | Scope, constraints, risk, and human-readable acceptance | Planner |
| `task.md` | Decomposition and verification matrix | Planner and Generator |
| `acceptance.json` | Machine-readable criterion state and evidence pointers | Generator, verified by Evaluator |
| `progress.md` | Cross-session handoff and resume point | Current operator |
| `contract.md` | Generator–Evaluator boundary, evidence standard, and verdict authority | Planner and Evaluator |

The artifacts form a closed loop:

```text
Intent -> Plan -> Generate -> Observe -> Evaluate -> Decide
   ^                                                |
   +---------- Institutionalize evidence -----------+
```

The Generator may propose that a criterion passes. The Evaluator owns the independent verdict for G2 and G3 work. Neither role may silently weaken acceptance criteria after implementation begins.

## Information Layers

```text
L0 Entry point: AGENTS.md
  └─ L1 Domain policies: architecture / governance / workflows / rules
       └─ L2 Task context: changes/<change-id>/
            └─ L3 Deep references: docs/reference/ and skill references
```

Read L0 by default. Enter L1 according to the task, load L2 only while working on that change, and consult L3 only when detailed knowledge or evidence is required.

## Control Plane and Project Plane

- **Kernel control plane (this repository):** Organization defaults, cross-domain workflow, routing protocol, templates, Skills, maturity models, and audit standards.
- **Domain plane (`harness-engineering-domain-packs`):** Versioned professional functions, route metadata, capability contracts, domain workflows, rules, Skills, and evaluators.
- **Project plane (product repositories):** Project architecture, Domain Pack overlays, project rules, tests, and concrete change records.
- **Synchronization:** The control plane publishes versions. Projects explicitly adopt a version and record deviations; updates never silently overwrite project-specific policy.

The detailed boundary, lifecycle, precedence, and runtime distribution model is defined in [ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md). The task-to-capability protocol is defined in [ROUTING.md](ROUTING.md).

## Scaling Principles

- Organize rules as organization defaults, domain rules, and project rules. Rules become more specific closer to the project but cannot weaken organizational red lines.
- Discover professional capabilities through a registry and load full Domain Pack content only after a conforming resolver selects it.
- Assign each skill to a domain owner and require a clear trigger description, input/output contract, and validation method.
- Make every automated decision traceable to a rule, test, or human approval.
- Treat logs, health checks, traces, screenshots, and reproducible user journeys as agent inputs, not operational exhaust.
- Bound autonomy by risk, permissions, external effects, cost, and mandatory checkpoints.
- Begin metrics with the presence and quality of evidence, then add efficiency and quality trends as the system matures.
