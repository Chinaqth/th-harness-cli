# 3+1 Workflow

## Phase 1: Plan

Input: objective, background, and constraints.

Outputs:

- `requirements.md`: problem, scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria, and risks;
- `task.md`: verifiable implementation steps;
- `acceptance.json`: machine-readable criterion status and evidence pointers;
- `progress.md`: current state, handoff, and exact resume point;
- `contract.md`: Generator–Evaluator responsibilities and evidence standard;
- `decision.md` when the change requires an important trade-off.

Artifact depth is risk-proportional:

| Risk | Required record |
| --- | --- |
| G0 | Pull request or task description with acceptance and evidence |
| G1 | `requirements.md`, `task.md`, and `progress.md` |
| G2 / G3 | All six artifacts, including `decision.md` |

Before implementation, a human confirms high-impact assumptions and all G1-or-higher decisions. G2 and G3 plans must also declare the autonomy budgets from `docs/AUTONOMY_POLICY.md`.

### Route to Professional Capabilities

After the objective is clear and before implementation begins:

1. Normalize the request into a Task Envelope.
2. Read the project Domain overlay and configured Domain registry.
3. Select only active, compatible capabilities and resolve their dependencies.
4. Record the resulting Routing Plan, including Pack versions, workflows, Skills, tools, evaluators, permissions, reasons, and conflicts.
5. Load only the selected Domain content.

If the result is `needs_input`, `needs_approval`, or `unroutable`, resolve that state before implementation. Do not invent a capability or bypass a missing approval.

## Phase 2: Implement

- Modify only the approved scope.
- Load rules, skills, and external tools on demand.
- Follow the Routing Plan and record any capability or dependency change that forces rerouting.
- Establish an observable failure before implementing a fix.
- Run the relevant check after each verifiable unit of work.
- Update `acceptance.json` only from observable evidence, not implementation confidence.
- Refresh `progress.md` at every checkpoint, handoff, pause, or material discovery.
- Return to planning when the scope changes.

At the end of a session, leave a handoff containing:

- current criterion and task state;
- the last verified revision and environment;
- completed work and evidence;
- blockers, unresolved decisions, and residual risks;
- the next smallest safe action and exact resume command or entry point.

## Phase 3: Evaluate and Deliver

The Evaluator starts from `contract.md`, establishes an independent baseline, and checks:

1. Acceptance criteria;
2. Correctness and boundary conditions;
3. Security, privacy, and permissions;
4. Architecture and compatibility;
5. Test quality;
6. Documentation and rollback.

For G2 and G3 work, the Evaluator must reproduce the critical user-visible journey, review the evidence contract, and record a pass, fail, or blocked verdict. A blocked verdict is not a pass.

Every pull request includes verification evidence, evaluator identity or execution context, residual risks, and rollback guidance.

## +1: Institutionalize

- Move completed changes to `changes/archive/`.
- Merge durable conclusions into architecture, rules, or skills.
- Add new failure modes to audit rules or evaluation suites.
- Promote reusable professional practice to the owning Domain Pack; keep project facts in the project overlay.
- Record metrics and remove temporary context that is no longer valid.
- Run knowledge gardening to find broken references, stale active changes, superseded guidance, and temporary artifacts.
