# Domain Pack Architecture

## Purpose

A Domain Pack converts a business function into a discoverable, versioned capability surface. It defines when a future conforming resolver may consider the function, what it owns, which workflows and Skills it provides, which tools it needs, and how its output is evaluated. This repository provides contracts and content; it does not provide a production routing runtime.

## Layering

```text
Harness Kernel
  -> Global Domain Pack
       -> Project Domain Overlay
            -> Task Contract
```

- The Kernel defines cross-domain invariants and task state.
- A Domain Pack defines reusable professional practice.
- A project overlay adds product architecture, commands, design systems, and local constraints.
- A task contract adds the current objective, scope, evidence, and temporary limits.

Professional behavior becomes more specific closer to the task. Safety constraints use the strictest applicable rule and cannot be weakened by a lower layer.

| Artifact | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `DOMAIN.md` | Human-readable purpose, boundaries, inputs, outputs, and maturity |
| `README-CH.md` | Chinese inventory of each production artifact's responsibility and behavior; never an independent policy source |
| `domain.json` | Stable identity, lifecycle, ownership, inheritance, and applicability |
| `routes.json` | Conditions a future conforming resolver may use to consider this Domain |
| `capabilities.json` | Workflows, Skills, tools, evaluators, permissions, and dependencies |
| `owners.json` | Primary owner and optional reviewers |
| `rules/` | Domain invariants that specialize but do not weaken the Kernel |
| `workflows/` | Repeatable domain delivery sequences |
| `evaluators/` | Domain-specific acceptance and evidence contracts |
| `templates/` | Reusable domain artifacts |
| `skills/` | Domain-owned Skill source |

## Discovery and Routing

The routing protocol requires a future resolver to read `registry/domains.json`, then load only candidate manifests and route metadata. A conforming implementation must not load every Domain Pack body into context.

```text
Task Envelope
  -> Domain registry candidates
  -> route condition evaluation
  -> capability dependency resolution
  -> policy and permission filtering
  -> routing plan
  -> selected workflows, Skills, tools, and evaluators
```

The registry is the fact source. Model reasoning may interpret ambiguous intent and compose work packages, but it must not invent unregistered capabilities.

All registered JSON documents are checked against the schemas in `schemas/`. Lifecycle validation
adds semantic gates that JSON Schema alone cannot express: an active Pack must have a named owner,
meaningful routes and capabilities, evaluator coverage, a compatibility statement, and resolvable
references and dependencies. Successful completion automatically sets the Pack active.

## Distribution

The Git repository is authoritative. An installer may publish versioned Domain Packs to `~/.harness/domains/` and selected Skills to `~/.agents/skills/`. Projects may optionally declare versions and overlays without copying the complete Pack.
